# REST-API
<p>A simple exercise of a rest api using MERN</p>
<p>The web is a simple , it only uses request by putting the longitud (-80 - -81) and the latitud (4 - 6)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mongo for the database ,I also use mongoose</li>
  <li>Express for mmake easy to use Node.js</li>
  <li>React for a single component that is the form and the result</li>
  <li>Node.js for the back-end</li>
</ul>
